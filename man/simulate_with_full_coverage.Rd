\title{Simulate Model with Full SMC Coverage}
\usage{
simulate_with_full_coverage(
  results,
  start_date,
  end_date,
  model,
  coverage_level = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{The MCMC results object containing the parameter samples.}

\item{start_date}{The start date for the simulation.}

\item{end_date}{The end date for the simulation.}

\item{model}{The model function to simulate from.}

\item{coverage_level}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 for the desired SMC coverage. Default is 1 (100\% coverage).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the simulation output with full or specified SMC coverage.
}
\description{
This function simulates the model with \code{cov_SMC} set to a user-defined level (default is 100\% coverage).
}
\examples{
sim_full_coverage <- simulate_with_full_coverage(results, start_date, end_date, model, coverage_level = 1)
}
