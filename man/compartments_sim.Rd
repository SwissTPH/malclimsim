\title{Simulate Compartments Over Time with Prewarm Period}
\usage{
compartments_sim(
  model,
  param_inputs,
  start_date,
  end_date,
  prewarm_years = 2,
  days_per_year = 360
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An epidemiological model object used for simulation.}

\item{param_inputs}{A named list or vector of model parameters to be used in the simulation.}

\item{start_date}{A character string or Date object specifying the start date of the main simulation (e.g., "2014-01-01").}

\item{end_date}{A character string or Date object specifying the end date of the simulation (e.g., "2022-12-31").}

\item{prewarm_years}{Integer specifying the number of years to prewarm the model before the main simulation (default: 2).}

\item{days_per_year}{Integer specifying the number of days in a model year (default: 360).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the simulated values of each compartment (SC, EC, IC, etc.)
over the simulation period with a weekly time resolution.
}
\description{
This function simulates the compartments of an epidemiological model over a specified time period,
including an optional prewarm period to allow the model to reach equilibrium before the main simulation period.
}
\details{
The function simulates the dynamics of susceptible, exposed, infected, treated, and recovered
compartments for both children and adults. It first runs a prewarm period (if specified) to allow the model to stabilize,
before simulating the main study period. The results are aggregated at weekly intervals.
