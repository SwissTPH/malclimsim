\usage{
gen_smc_schedule(
  start_date,
  end_date,
  years,
  months_active,
  months_30_days = FALSE,
  coverage = 0.9,
  smc_day_of_month = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_date}{Character. First date of the schedule ("YYYY-MM-DD").}

\item{end_date}{Character. Last  date of the schedule ("YYYY-MM-DD").}

\item{years}{Integer vector. Years included in the schedule.}

\item{months_active}{Matrix (n_years x 12) with 1 = SMC month, 0 = not.}

\item{months_30_days}{Logical. Use 360-day calendar (every month = 30 days)?}

\item{coverage}{Either \strong{(i)} a single numeric (legacy behaviour) or
\strong{(ii)} a numeric vector of length 12 \emph{or} a named vector
whose names are month numbers (1-12) / abbreviations
("Jan", "Feb", ...).  Values give coverage for each month.}

\item{smc_day_of_month}{Integer. Day of month SMC is administered.}
}
\value{
data.frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item dates - sequence of dates in the period
\item SMC   - 1 on round day, 0 otherwise
\item cov   - coverage applied (piecewise-constant blocks)
\item decay - efficacy decay computed from round days
}
