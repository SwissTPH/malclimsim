\title{Run Model Simulation with Pre-Warm Period}
\usage{
run_simulation_with_prewarm(
  model,
  param_inputs,
  dates,
  prewarm_years = 2,
  days_per_year = 360
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model object used for simulation (compatible with \code{data_sim()}).}

\item{param_inputs}{A list of model parameters, including time-varying covariates.}

\item{dates}{A vector of two dates: start and end of the target simulation window (as \code{Date} or string in \code{"YYYY-MM-DD"} format).}

\item{prewarm_years}{Integer; number of years to pre-warm the model before the actual simulation window. Defaults to 2.}

\item{days_per_year}{Integer; number of time steps per year (typically 360 or 365). Defaults to 360.}
}
\value{
A data frame of simulated results filtered to include only dates from the original \code{start_date} onward.
}
\description{
Extends time-varying covariate inputs and runs the model over a pre-warm period to allow system stabilization before the target simulation window.
}
\details{
Time-varying parameters are extended backward in time by repeating the first year's values for \code{prewarm_years}.
The simulation is then run over this extended window, and the pre-warm results are discarded to avoid initialization artifacts.

sim_results <- run_simulation_with_prewarm(
  model = malaria_model,
  param_inputs = parameters,
  dates = c("2020-01-01", "2022-12-31"),
  prewarm_years = 2
)
