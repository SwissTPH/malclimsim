\title{Extend Time-Varying Inputs Backwards in Time}
\usage{
extend_time_varying_inputs(
  param_inputs,
  days_per_year = 360,
  years_to_extend = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{param_inputs}{A named list of model input vectors, where some elements may be time-varying (e.g., daily values).}

\item{days_per_year}{Integer specifying the number of time steps (e.g., days) per year. Defaults to 360.}

\item{years_to_extend}{Number of years to prepend to each time-varying input by repeating the first year's data. Defaults to 2.}
}
\value{
A list with the same structure as \code{param_inputs}, where selected time-varying inputs have been extended backward in time.
}
\description{
This function extends selected time-varying inputs by repeating the first year's data
backwards for a specified number of years. This is useful when simulating models that
require initialization over an extended period.
}
\details{
The following keys are treated as time-varying and extended:
\code{"cov_SMC"}, \code{"SMC"}, \code{"decay"}, \code{"c_R_D"}, \code{"temp"}.
Other keys are left unchanged.
}
\examples{
inputs <- list(
  cov_SMC = rep(0.5, 360 * 3),
  temp = rep(25, 360 * 3),
  constant = 42
)
extended <- extend_time_varying_inputs(inputs, days_per_year = 360, years_to_extend = 1)
length(extended$cov_SMC)  # should be 360 * 4

}
