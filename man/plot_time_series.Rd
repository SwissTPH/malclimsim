}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A data frame containing malaria incidence data with columns for
date (\code{date_ymd}), and incidence counts for different age groups (e.g.,
\code{inc_A}, \code{inc_C}, \code{inc} for \verb{<5}, \verb{>=5}, and \code{total} respectively).}

\item{met}{A data frame containing climate data with columns for date (\code{date}),
rainfall, temperature, and other relevant climate variables.
The date column in this data must match the date format used in \code{results}.}

\item{plot_title}{A string for the title of the plot. Default is "Time Series Data".}

\item{incidence_y_label}{A string for the y-axis label of the incidence plot.
Default is "Monthly Malaria Cases".}

\item{climate_y_label}{A string for the y-axis label of the climate data plot.
Default is "Temperature (°C)".}

\item{climate_facet}{A boolean value indicating whether to facet the plots
(separate plots for incidence and climate data) or not.
Default is \code{FALSE} (plots will be overlaid).}

\item{select_incidence}{A vector of incidence types to include in the plot.
Options are \code{">=5"}, \code{"<5"}, and \code{"total"}. Default is all three.}

\item{select_climate}{A vector of climate variables to include in the plot.
Options are \code{"temp"} (temperature) and \code{"rollrain"} (rolling mean).
Default is both \code{"temp"} and \code{"rollrain"}.}

\item{incidence_colors}{A named vector of colors for the selected incidence types.
Default is \code{">=5" = "blue"}, \code{"<5" = "red"}, \code{"total" = "green"}.}

\item{climate_colors}{A named vector of colors for the selected climate variables.
Default is \code{"temp" = "orange"}, \code{"rollrain" = "purple"}.}

\item{climate_alpha}{A numeric value controlling the transparency of the climate data
lines. Default is 0.7 (semi-transparent).}

\item{base_size}{A numeric value controlling the base font size of the plot.
Default is 15.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object containing the time series plot(s) of malaria incidence and climate data.
}
\description{
This function creates time series plots for malaria incidence and climate data,
with options to customize which incidence types (under 5 years, 5 years and older,
or total) and climate variables (temperature or rolling mean) are displayed.
The user can also choose to facet the plots or overlay them for better visualization.

\examples{
# Example 1: Plotting only the total incidence of malaria
plot_time_series(results = results, plot_title = "Total Malaria Incidence", select_incidence = "total")

# Example 2: Plotting malaria incidence and climate data (temperature only)
plot_time_series(results = results, met = met, plot_title = "Malaria and Temperature",
                 select_incidence = c(">=5", "<5"), select_climate = "temp")

# Example 3: Plotting both incidence and climate data with faceting
plot_time_series(results = results, met = met, plot_title = "Malaria and Climate Data",
                 select_incidence = "total", select_climate = c("temp", "rollrain"),
                 climate_facet = TRUE)
