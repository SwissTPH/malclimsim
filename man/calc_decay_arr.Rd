\title{Calculate Normalized SMC Decay Array Over Time}
\usage{
calc_decay_arr(SMC, decay_func = decay_SMC, const = -0.1806)
}
\arguments{
\item{SMC}{Numeric vector. Time series indicating the presence (positive value) or absence (zero) of SMC at each time point.}

\item{decay_func}{Function. Function defining the decay curve. Default is \code{decay_SMC}.}

\item{const}{Numeric. Decay constant to pass to \code{decay_func}. Default is -0.1806.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of the same length as \code{SMC}, with decay values normalized to a max of 1 per SMC round.
}
\description{
Generates a vector of normalized decayed SMC efficacies for a time series where SMC is applied intermittently.
Each decay curve is scaled so that its maximum value is 1.
}
\examples{
smc_series <- c(0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
calc_decay_arr(smc_series)
