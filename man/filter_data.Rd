\title{Relate Time Steps to Observed Data for mcstate}
\usage{
filter_data(incidence_observed, month = FALSE, initial_time_obs = 0, rate = 7)

filter_data(incidence_observed, month = FALSE, initial_time_obs = 0, rate = 7)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence_observed}{A data frame containing observed incidence data.}

\item{month}{Logical; TRUE for monthly data, FALSE for weekly data.}

\item{initial_time_obs}{Integer; initial time step (e.g., 0), used to align simulation and data.}

\item{rate}{Integer; time step rate (7 for weekly, 30 for monthly, etc.).}
}
\value{
A data frame with filtered data, including time intervals and the appropriate columns for particle filtering.

A data frame formatted for particle filtering, with aligned start/end time steps.
}
\description{
This function formats observed data into a form usable by the \code{mcstate} particle filter, adjusting for time steps (weeks or months) and ensuring the data is in the correct format for particle filtering.

This function formats observed data into a form usable by the \code{mcstate} particle filter,
adjusting for time steps (weekly or monthly) and ensuring consistency for particle filtering.

\examples{
# Assuming 'incidence_observed' is a data frame with your observed data
formatted_data <- relate_time_steps_to_observed_data(incidence_observed, month = FALSE, initial_time_obs = 0, rate = 7)
