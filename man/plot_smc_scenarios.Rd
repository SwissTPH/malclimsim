\usage{
plot_smc_scenarios(
  observed_df,
  no_smc_df,
  current_smc_df,
  full_smc_df,
  groups = c("inc_A", "inc_C", "inc"),
  include_observed = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed_df}{A data frame of observed malaria cases with columns for \code{date_ymd}, \code{inc_A}, \code{inc_C}, and \code{inc}.}

\item{no_smc_df}{A data frame of simulated malaria cases with no SMC (\code{eff_SMC = 0}).}

\item{current_smc_df}{A data frame of simulated malaria cases with current SMC coverage.}

\item{full_smc_df}{A data frame of simulated malaria cases with full SMC coverage.}

\item{groups}{A character vector specifying which groups to include in the plot (\code{inc_A}, \code{inc_C}, \code{inc}).}

\item{include_observed}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, includes observed data in the plot. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object displaying the simulated data for different SMC scenarios (and optionally observed data).
}
\description{
This function plots the simulated malaria cases for different SMC coverage scenarios,
including "No SMC", "Current Coverage", and "Full SMC Coverage" scenarios.
It optionally includes observed data for comparison.
}
\examples{
# Assuming the scenarios have been simulated and stored as `observed`, `no_smc`, `current_smc`, `full_smc`
plot_smc_scenarios(observed, no_smc, current_smc, full_smc, groups = c("inc_A", "inc_C", "inc"), include_observed = TRUE)
