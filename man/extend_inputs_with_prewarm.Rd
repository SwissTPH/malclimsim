\title{Prepend Prewarm Climate to Your True Analysis Series}
\usage{
extend_inputs_with_prewarm(
  param_inputs,
  start_date,
  end_date,
  prewarm_years,
  days_per_year = 360
)
}
\arguments{
\item{param_inputs}{Named list of inputs, where time‑varying elements
include "cov_SMC", "SMC", "decay", "c_R_D", "temp".
Each of those should be a numeric vector of length = raw_analysis_days.}

\item{start_date}{Date at which your real series begins (e.g. "2018-01-01").}

\item{end_date}{Date at which your real series ends   (e.g. "2023-12-31").}

\item{prewarm_years}{Integer number of 360‑day years to prepend.}

\item{days_per_year}{Number of days per model year (default: 360).}
}
\value{
A list like \code{param_inputs} but with each time‑varying vector
extended to length = prewarm_years*360 + floor(analysis_days/7)*7.
}
\description{
Takes your genuine, day‑1–to‑day‑N climate vectors (temp, rain, etc.)
and builds a single vector of length prewarm_years\emph{360 + analysis_days,
where the first prewarm_years}360 days are just repeats of the first
360 days of your real series, and the last analysis_days days are the
real data you passed in.
