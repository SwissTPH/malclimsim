\title{Create Observation Function Configuration}
\usage{
make_obs_config(
  use_monthly = TRUE,
  age_group = "u5",
  include_prev = FALSE,
  use_SMC_as_covariate = FALSE,
  log_link = FALSE,
  include_pop_growth = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{use_monthly}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, observation and model outputs are matched at monthly resolution;
otherwise, weekly data is assumed.}

\item{age_group}{Character. One of \code{"u5"}, \code{"o5"}, \code{"sep_ages"}, \code{"total"}, or \code{"all_ages"}.
This determines which age group(s) are included in the likelihood.}

\item{include_prev}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the observation function includes a prevalence likelihood term.}

\item{use_SMC_as_covariate}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the incidence is adjusted using a regression effect (\code{beta_1}) on SMC coverage.}

\item{log_link}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, a log-link is used to transform the predicted incidence when adjusting by SMC coverage.
If \code{FALSE}, a linear form is used.}

\item{include_pop_growth}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, model-predicted incidence is rescaled to account for
population growth using the \code{r_C} and/or \code{r_A} outputs from the model.}
}
\value{
A named list containing configuration options to pass to the observation likelihood function.
}
\description{
Constructs a configuration list specifying how to compare observed and modeled data.
This configuration is passed to the observation likelihood generator function
(\code{generate_incidence_comparison()}) and determines which outcomes are compared and how.
